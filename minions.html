        <h4>The Story Behind</h4>
        <p>With tiny boots and goggles wide,
This Minion stands in cheeky pride.
A heart-shaped balloon, floating near,
Tells us love and laughs are here.

Hands on hips, with charm so bright,
He's mischief wrapped in yellow light.
No grand speech or fancy art,
Just silly grins and a kind heart.

He may not talk in proper prose,
But joy is something he surely knows.
In overalls and goofy grace,
He brings a smile to every face.

So if you're down or feel apart,
Just borrow his balloon-shaped heart.
For in this world that moves too fast,
A Minionâ€™s love is made to last. ðŸ’›
