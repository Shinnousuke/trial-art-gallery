<h4>
        With tiny boots and goggles wide,<br>
This Minion stands in cheeky pride.<br>
A heart-shaped balloon, floating near,<br>
Tells us love and laughs are here.<br>

Hands on hips, with charm so bright,<br>
He's mischief wrapped in yellow light.<br>
No grand speech or fancy art,<br>
Just silly grins and a kind heart.<br>

He may not talk in proper prose,<br>
But joy is something he surely knows.<br>
In overalls and goofy grace,<br>
He brings a smile to every face.<br>

So if you're down or feel apart,<br>
Just borrow his balloon-shaped heart.<br>
For in this world that moves too fast,<br>
A Minionâ€™s love is made to last. ðŸ’›<br>
