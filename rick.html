        <h4>
        In a lab coat smeared with cosmic dust,<br>
Rick burped loud, “Paint we must!”<br>
With portal gun and paint in hand,<br>
He dragged young Morty to artland.<br>

“Geez Rick, is this a museum trip?”<br>
“No Morty, it’s an acid-drip!”<br>
Splash of neon, a stroke so wild,<br>
The chaos screamed like a techno child.<br>

Blue hair spiked like lightning’s kiss,<br>
Morty's face—a worried abyss.<br>
Frozen mid-"Oh no!" on a crimson stage,<br>
Their tale now trapped in painted rage.<br>

Behind them hang wise owls in flight,<br>
Silent watchers of dimension's plight.<br>
A canvas small, but story grand,<br>
A duo lost in brush and strand.<br>

So here they are, in color bold,<br>
A tale of madness, truth retold.<br>
Not just science, nor TV fame—<br>
But art that screams their twisted name.<br>

“Morty,” Rick said, with eyes ablaze,<br>
“Immortality? Just some acrylic haze.”<br>
