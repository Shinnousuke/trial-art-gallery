        <h4>The Story Behind</h4>
        <p>In a lab coat smeared with cosmic dust,
Rick burped loud, “Paint we must!”
With portal gun and paint in hand,
He dragged young Morty to artland.

“Geez Rick, is this a museum trip?”
“No Morty, it’s an acid-drip!”
Splash of neon, a stroke so wild,
The chaos screamed like a techno child.

Blue hair spiked like lightning’s kiss,
Morty's face—a worried abyss.
Frozen mid-"Oh no!" on a crimson stage,
Their tale now trapped in painted rage.

Behind them hang wise owls in flight,
Silent watchers of dimension's plight.
A canvas small, but story grand,
A duo lost in brush and strand.

So here they are, in color bold,
A tale of madness, truth retold.
Not just science, nor TV fame—
But art that screams their twisted name.

“Morty,” Rick said, with eyes ablaze,
“Immortality? Just some acrylic haze.”
