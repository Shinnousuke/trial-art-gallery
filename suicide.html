       <h4>
        Behind the smile, the daily act,<br>
A storm brews quiet, sharp and cracked.<br>
He holds a letter, weary eyes,<br>
A silent plea beneath the cries.<br>

She stands in shock, a heart in ache,<br>
Too late to see the soul that breaks.<br>
The words unsaid, the pain unknown,<br>
He fought his battles all alone.<br>

No crowd to cheer, no hand to hold,<br>
Just shadows whispering tales untold.<br>
A weight too heavy, masked by grace,<br>
Now sorrow haunts this fragile space.<br>

Let this frame not just portray pain,<br>
But urge us all to check again.<br>
Behind each ‚Äúfine,‚Äù there may reside<br>
A war someone tries hard to hide.<br>

So pause, reach out, and truly see‚Äî<br>
A kind word might just set them free.<br>
For even the strong can feel alone‚Ä¶<br>
Let no one fight their dark unknown. üñ§<br>
