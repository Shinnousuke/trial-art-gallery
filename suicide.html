        <h4>The Story Behind</h4>
        <p>Behind the smile, the daily act,
A storm brews quiet, sharp and cracked.
He holds a letter, weary eyes,
A silent plea beneath the cries.

She stands in shock, a heart in ache,
Too late to see the soul that breaks.
The words unsaid, the pain unknown,
He fought his battles all alone.

No crowd to cheer, no hand to hold,
Just shadows whispering tales untold.
A weight too heavy, masked by grace,
Now sorrow haunts this fragile space.

Let this frame not just portray pain,
But urge us all to check again.
Behind each ‚Äúfine,‚Äù there may reside
A war someone tries hard to hide.

So pause, reach out, and truly see‚Äî
A kind word might just set them free.
For even the strong can feel alone‚Ä¶
Let no one fight their dark unknown. üñ§
