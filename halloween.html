        <h4>The Story Behind</h4>
        <p>In the land where shadows softly glide,
Where pumpkins grin and spirits bide,
A skeletal king stands tall and still,
With stitched-up smile and ghostly will.

Jack, the monarch of midnight skies,
With wonder deep in hollow eyes,
Wears grace like bone-white evening wear,
A dashing ghost with a velvet stare.

Beside him glows the jack-o’-light,
A flickering flame in the velvet night.
They dance in silence, dark and bright,
A duo born of eerie delight.

No fear, no screams, just style refined,
Where cobwebs twirl and dreams unwind.
In Halloweentown’s sacred breath,
There lies a charm even in death.

So if you fear what waits beyond,
Look to the one the ghouls are fond.
For death is not the end, but rife—
With elegance in the afterlife.
