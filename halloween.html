        <h4>
        In the land where shadows softly glide,<br>
Where pumpkins grin and spirits bide,<br>
A skeletal king stands tall and still,<br>
With stitched-up smile and ghostly will.<br>

Jack, the monarch of midnight skies,<br>
With wonder deep in hollow eyes,<br>
Wears grace like bone-white evening wear,<br>
A dashing ghost with a velvet stare.<br>

Beside him glows the jack-o’-light,<br>
A flickering flame in the velvet night.<br>
They dance in silence, dark and bright,<br>
A duo born of eerie delight.<br>

No fear, no screams, just style refined,<br>
Where cobwebs twirl and dreams unwind.<br>
In Halloweentown’s sacred breath,<br>
There lies a charm even in death.<br>

So if you fear what waits beyond,<br>
Look to the one the ghouls are fond.<br>
For death is not the end, but rife—<br>
With elegance in the afterlife.<br>
