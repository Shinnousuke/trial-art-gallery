        <h4>
       Perched in stillness, drawn in grace,<br>
A thousand patterns fill her face.<br>
Each feather inked with care and art,<br>
A silent map of a mindful heart.<br>

Eyes like moons—so round, so wide,<br>
Holding secrets time can’t hide.<br>
She doesn’t speak, yet seems to know<br>
The hush of night, the drift of snow.<br>

No splash of hue, no vibrant tone,<br>
Just black on white—yet not alone.<br>
For in those lines, so neatly spun,<br>
Lies every dusk and every sun.<br>

Each scale, each swirl, each silent thread,<br>
Recites the words we’ve left unsaid.<br>
Of quiet strength, of silent flight,<br>
Of knowing wrong, and seeking right.<br>

She perches still, both bold and wise,<br>
A guardian drawn with steady eyes.<br>
In every curve, a tale unfurled—<br>
The ink-born watcher of the world.<br>
