        <h4>The Story Behind</h4>
        <p>In purple shades and calm repose,
Snoopy strikes his classic pose.
A sweater marked with just one rule—
“COOL,” it says, and oh, he’s cool.

No rush, no fuss, no frantic pace,
Just timeless chill on that beagle face.
He walks like jazz, he dreams like breeze,
A pup at peace, forever at ease.

No drama here, no need to bark,
He’s sipping style from morning till dark.
Whether skies are bright or gray,
Snoopy vibes the stress away.

So when life feels a bit too tight,
Channel Snoopy’s mellow light.
Throw on some shades, just let it slide—
And live in that Snoopy state of mind. 🕶️🐾
