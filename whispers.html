        <h4>
        In purple shades and calm repose,<br>
Snoopy strikes his classic pose.<br>
A sweater marked with just one rule—<br>
“COOL,” it says, and oh, he’s cool.<br>

No rush, no fuss, no frantic pace,<br>
Just timeless chill on that beagle face.<br>
He walks like jazz, he dreams like breeze,<br>
A pup at peace, forever at ease.<br>

No drama here, no need to bark,<br>
He’s sipping style from morning till dark.<br>
Whether skies are bright or gray,<br>
Snoopy vibes the stress away.<br>

So when life feels a bit too tight,<br>
Channel Snoopy’s mellow light.<br>
Throw on some shades, just let it slide—<br>
And live in that Snoopy state of mind. 🕶️🐾<br>
