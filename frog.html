      <h4>
        With hearts afloat on a rosy sky,<br>
And stars of love in each wide eye,<br>
Kermit stands with subtle charm,<br>
One hand tucked, the other calm.<br>

A little blush, a bashful grin,<br>
A green frog lost in thoughts within.<br>
No need for words or grand display,<br>
His smile says all he wants to say.<br>

Perhaps it‚Äôs love, or maybe glee,<br>
Or daydreams sipping sweet iced tea.<br>
But either way, he's clearly caught‚Äî<br>
In that soft, warm, fluttery thought.<br>

So if you're feeling just a bit shy,<br>
Take a cue from this froggy guy.<br>
Love is quiet, sweet, and true‚Äî<br>
Just like Kermit smiling at you. ‚ù§Ô∏èüê∏
