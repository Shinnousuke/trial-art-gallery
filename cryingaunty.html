        <h4>The Story Behind</h4>
        <p>She stood with grace, a summer bloom,
Until the pollen spelled her doom.
A tickle rose, a sneeze took flight,
And peace was lost to allergy's might.

Her dupatta flailed like a warning flag,
Her eyes grew red, her steps would drag.
One hand a tissue, one mid-air —
The drama of dust danced everywhere.

She didn’t cry from heartbreak’s sting,
But from the wrath that flowers bring.
Achoo! She sniffled, loud and proud,
Her sneezes echoing through the crowd.

“Who needs perfumes or springtime cheer,
When itchy noses live so near?”
Yet through the sneezes, tears, and sighs,
She fought on strong — with watery eyes.

For heroes come in many forms,
Some brave the storms, some brave the swarms.
And some, like her, just try to breathe,
When allergies refuse to leave.
