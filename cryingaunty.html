       <h4>
        She stood with grace, a summer bloom,<br>
Until the pollen spelled her doom.<br>
A tickle rose, a sneeze took flight,<br>
And peace was lost to allergy's might.<br>

Her dupatta flailed like a warning flag,<br>
Her eyes grew red, her steps would drag.<br>
One hand a tissue, one mid-air —<br>
The drama of dust danced everywhere.<br>

She didn’t cry from heartbreak’s sting,<br>
But from the wrath that flowers bring.<br>
Achoo! She sniffled, loud and proud,<br>
Her sneezes echoing through the crowd.<br>

“Who needs perfumes or springtime cheer,<br>
When itchy noses live so near?”<br>
Yet through the sneezes, tears, and sighs,<br>
She fought on strong — with watery eyes.<br>

For heroes come in many forms,<br>
Some brave the storms, some brave the swarms.<br>
And some, like her, just try to breathe,<br>
When allergies refuse to leave.<br>
