        <h4>The Story Behind</h4>
        <p>In a house that barely stands,
Lives Oggy, cat with trembling hands.
He seeks his peace, his quiet tea—
But three wild pests shout, “Not today, whee!”

Dee Dee munches all in sight,
Marky dances through the night,
Joey plots with wicked glee—
A trio born for anarchy.

Oggy yells, and pans go flying,
Insects laugh while barely trying.
Booms and bangs, cartoon delight,
It’s war again by morning light.

Yet in this mess, there lies a charm,
No one really means much harm.
A slapstick dance, a daily jest,
That captures “The Art of Cat and Pest.”

With bulging eyes and schemes so sly,
They’ll chase and fail, but always try.
No calm survives, no nap is blessed—
In Oggy's world, there's no real rest.

But deep beneath that comic chase,
Is weird affection, face to face.
For foes like these, you'd never trade—
A masterpiece of chaos made.
