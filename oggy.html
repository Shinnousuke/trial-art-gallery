         <h4>
        In a house that barely stands,<br>
Lives Oggy, cat with trembling hands.<br>
He seeks his peace, his quiet tea—<br>
But three wild pests shout, “Not today, whee!”<br>

Dee Dee munches all in sight,<br>
Marky dances through the night,<br>
Joey plots with wicked glee—<br>
A trio born for anarchy.<br>

Oggy yells, and pans go flying,<br>
Insects laugh while barely trying.<br>
Booms and bangs, cartoon delight,<br>
It’s war again by morning light.<br>

Yet in this mess, there lies a charm,<br>
No one really means much harm.<br>
A slapstick dance, a daily jest,<br>
That captures “The Art of Cat and Pest.”<br>

With bulging eyes and schemes so sly,<br>
They’ll chase and fail, but always try.<br>
No calm survives, no nap is blessed—<br>
In Oggy's world, there's no real rest.<br>

But deep beneath that comic chase,<br>
Is weird affection, face to face.<br>
For foes like these, you'd never trade—<br>
A masterpiece of chaos made.<br>
