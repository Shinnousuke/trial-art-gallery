        <h4>The Story Behind</h4>
        <p>I sat with numbers, bold and proud,
Thought I'd solve them, thinkin' aloud.
With pen in hand and furrowed brow,
“Where did that ‘x’ come from now?!”

I munched on snacks for focus, right?
But math just gave me stage fright.
I stared at sums with deepest care,
Only to find… they weren’t there.

“Divide by zero?” Wait—can I?
Why’s cosine waving me goodbye?
Square roots dancing, Pi on the run,
When did math stop being fun?

Theorems taunt me in ancient tongue,
My neurons cry, “We’re way too young!”
I scratch my head and eat some more,
Hoping logic walks through that door.

Each equation a riddle, twist, or trap,
Each solution needs a power nap.
But still I sit, in food-stained grace,
Solving math… at my own pace.

So here I am, no shame, no wrath—
A snack-filled soul on the path of math.
