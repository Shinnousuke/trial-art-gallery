        <h4>
        I sat with numbers, bold and proud,<br>
Thought I'd solve them, thinkin' aloud.<br>
With pen in hand and furrowed brow,<br>
“Where did that ‘x’ come from now?!”<br>

I munched on snacks for focus, right?<br>
But math just gave me stage fright.<br>
I stared at sums with deepest care,<br>
Only to find… they weren’t there.<br>

“Divide by zero?” Wait—can I?<br>
Why’s cosine waving me goodbye?<br>
Square roots dancing, Pi on the run,<br>
When did math stop being fun?<br>

Theorems taunt me in ancient tongue,<br>
My neurons cry, “We’re way too young!”<br>
I scratch my head and eat some more,<br>
Hoping logic walks through that door.<br>

Each equation a riddle, twist, or trap,<br>
Each solution needs a power nap.<br>
But still I sit, in food-stained grace,<br>
Solving math… at my own pace.<br>

So here I am, no shame, no wrath—<br>
A snack-filled soul on the path of math.<br>
