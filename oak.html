 <h4>
        In a flurry of frost and cottony white,<br>
A snowman twirls with pure delight.<br>
Buttoned up, with a carrot nose,<br>
He spins and giggles as the cold wind blows.<br>

Olaf’s laugh is warm as sun,<br>
Melting hearts, one by one.<br>
He dreams of summer, yet loves the snow,<br>
Dancing wherever cold winds blow.<br>

Arms out wide, he hugs the air,<br>
With snowflakes tangled in his hair.<br>
Each flake a friend, each gust a song,<br>
In Olaf’s world, you can’t go wrong.<br>

No need for boots, no need for hats,<br>
He plays with squirrels, birds, and cats!<br>
In frozen fields or icy run,<br>
Every day is snow much fun!<br>

So next time skies turn winter blue,<br>
Think of Olaf, and smile too—<br>
For joy is found in snowy sun,<br>
And snowmen made for frosty fun!<br>
