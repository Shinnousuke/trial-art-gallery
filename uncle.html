        <h4>The Story Behind</h4>
        <p>

In a blue shirt worn and softly creased,
He sat alone, the chatter ceased.
Before him lay a humble plate,
Of puris warm — a twist of fate.

Two bowls of chutney, side by side,
Like memories he could never hide.
Each bite a tale from days gone past,
Of love once near, now fading fast.

Her laughter echoed in the air,
Though empty sat the second chair.
He chewed in silence, slow and deep,
As if to taste the tears he’d weep.

No feast of kings, no lavish fare,
Just golden rounds and love laid bare.
The oil, the spice, the softest dough,
Held more than anyone could know.

“For you,” he sighed with eyes so wide,
Still waiting for her by his side.
And in that bite, both joy and pain —
A heart that broke, and loved again.
