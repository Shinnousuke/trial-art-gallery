        <h4>
        

In a blue shirt worn and softly creased,<br>
He sat alone, the chatter ceased.<br>
Before him lay a humble plate,<br>
Of puris warm — a twist of fate.<br>

Two bowls of chutney, side by side,<br>
Like memories he could never hide.<br>
Each bite a tale from days gone past,<br>
Of love once near, now fading fast.<br>

Her laughter echoed in the air,<br>
Though empty sat the second chair.<br>
He chewed in silence, slow and deep,<br>
As if to taste the tears he’d weep.<br>

No feast of kings, no lavish fare,<br>
Just golden rounds and love laid bare.<br>
The oil, the spice, the softest dough,<br>
Held more than anyone could know.<br>

“For you,” he sighed with eyes so wide,<br>
Still waiting for her by his side.<br>
And in that bite, both joy and pain —<br>
A heart that broke, and loved again.<br>
