        <h4>
        She stomps in slippers, hair a flame,<br>
In a pink robe, with zero shame.<br>
A mug in hand, eyes barely wide—<br>
The caffeine’s low, but so is pride.<br>

Across the room, with perfect poise,<br>
Another sighs through morning noise.<br>
Books stacked tall, a clipboard too,<br>
She’s been up since half past two.<br>

"Ma'am, please sit. We’ll start real soon."<br>
"Not now," she growls, "I need a spoon."<br>
“To stir the rage?” the teacher thinks,<br>
While counting to ten with patient blinks.<br>

One speaks math, the other groans,<br>
One quotes facts, the other moans.<br>
It's dawn of class and war alike—<br>
A lecture meets a mental strike.<br>

Still, every day this scene repeats,<br>
Through sleepy eyes and shuffled seats.<br>
And though they clash, it’s understood:<br>
One needs her bean, one needs her good.<br>

So raise a toast to days like these—<br>
With coffee mugs and silent pleas.<br>
For classrooms thrive, by fate’s strange dance:<br>
Of grumpy minds, and teacher’s stance.<br>
