        <h4>The Story Behind</h4>
        <p>She stomps in slippers, hair a flame,
In a pink robe, with zero shame.
A mug in hand, eyes barely wide—
The caffeine’s low, but so is pride.

Across the room, with perfect poise,
Another sighs through morning noise.
Books stacked tall, a clipboard too,
She’s been up since half past two.

"Ma'am, please sit. We’ll start real soon."
"Not now," she growls, "I need a spoon."
“To stir the rage?” the teacher thinks,
While counting to ten with patient blinks.

One speaks math, the other groans,
One quotes facts, the other moans.
It's dawn of class and war alike—
A lecture meets a mental strike.

Still, every day this scene repeats,
Through sleepy eyes and shuffled seats.
And though they clash, it’s understood:
One needs her bean, one needs her good.

So raise a toast to days like these—
With coffee mugs and silent pleas.
For classrooms thrive, by fate’s strange dance:
Of grumpy minds, and teacher’s stance.
