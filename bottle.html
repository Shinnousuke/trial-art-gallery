          <h4>
        Once, there was a bottle — not of wine, but of stored emotion.<br>
Not corked with fear, but sealed in stillness.<br>

Inside it swirled years of laughter left unsaid,<br>
tears never poured, and moments aged like fine vintage <br>
— waiting for the right time to uncork.<br>

Around it bloomed mandalas — not just patterns, <br>
but maps of the soul, etched layer by layer with the experiences that shaped her.<br>
Each curve told a memory. Each triangle held tension. Each flower was a breath of peace.<br>

The bottle wasn’t broken — it was beautifully full.<br>
Not of something to escape from…<br>
…but something to finally share.<br>

Because when the right soul arrives —<br>
You don’t spill.<br>
You pour with grace.<br>
