        <h4>The Story Behind</h4>
        <p>Half-asleep and fully done,
Garfield stares like joyless fun.
Monday's enemy, lasagna’s knight,
He yawns at day and shuns the light.

With sleepy eyes and silent sass,
He lets the nonsense slowly pass.
No rush, no chase, no sudden flair—
Just judgment from his lazy stare.

He’s not impressed, he’s not amused,
He'd rather nap than be enthused.
But in that frown and bored disguise,
Lies a cat both clever and wise.

So if the world feels much too fast,
Just Garfield it — and let it pass.
Put on your shoes, or maybe don’t,
Do what you want. (He surely won’t.)
