        <h4>
        Half-asleep and fully done,<br>
Garfield stares like joyless fun.<br>
Monday's enemy, lasagna’s knight,<br>
He yawns at day and shuns the light.<br>

With sleepy eyes and silent sass,<br>
He lets the nonsense slowly pass.<br>
No rush, no chase, no sudden flair—<br>
Just judgment from his lazy stare.<br>

He’s not impressed, he’s not amused,<br>
He'd rather nap than be enthused.<br>
But in that frown and bored disguise,<br>
Lies a cat both clever and wise.<br>

So if the world feels much too fast,<br>
Just Garfield it — and let it pass.<br>
Put on your shoes, or maybe don’t,<br>
Do what you want. (He surely won’t.)<br>
