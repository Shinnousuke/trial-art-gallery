        <h4>
        Carved in ink, yet born of sound,<br>
A flute lies still on sacred ground.<br>
No lips to breathe, no hands to play,<br>
Yet songs within it softly stay.<br>

Adorned with swirls and mandala light,<br>
A silent echo of pure delight.<br>
Its patterns sing of ancient lore,<br>
Of love, of peace, of evermore.<br>

Leaf and stem like rhythm flow,<br>
As winds of grace around it blow.<br>
Nature listens, hushed and kind,<br>
To the music sketched in line and mind.<br>

It needs no color, voice, or fame,<br>
Its beauty hums without a name.<br>
A whisper drawn in black and white,<br>
A melody caught in morning light.<br>

O seeker still with hurried feet,<br>
Pause here, where art and stillness meet.<br>
For in this frame of form and root,<br>
Sleeps the soulâ€¦ of a gentle flute.<br>
