        <h4>The Story Behind</h4>
        <p>In a forest where no maps would go,
Strange mushrooms rise and colors glow.
With checker caps and stalks so tall,
They whisper secrets to trees and all.

A blue one hums a haunting tune,
A striped one sways beneath the moon.
The red one guards the forest gate,
Its patterns bold, its stance ornate.

Leaves curl like tongues in silent speech,
And tendrils twist just out of reach.
A world unseen by light of day,
Where dreams and roots begin to play.

Each stem and swirl, a hidden lore,
A place where minds begin to soar.
Not just mushrooms, no — they’re keys,
To lands beyond the winds and trees.

So linger here, and breathe in deep,
Let silence through your senses seep.
For in this frame, wild magic grows—
A forest only dreamers know.
