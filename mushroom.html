       <h4>
        In a forest where no maps would go,<br>
Strange mushrooms rise and colors glow.<br>
With checker caps and stalks so tall,<br>
They whisper secrets to trees and all.<br>

A blue one hums a haunting tune,<br>
A striped one sways beneath the moon.<br>
The red one guards the forest gate,<br>
Its patterns bold, its stance ornate.<br>

Leaves curl like tongues in silent speech,<br>
And tendrils twist just out of reach.<br>
A world unseen by light of day,<br>
Where dreams and roots begin to play.<br>

Each stem and swirl, a hidden lore,<br>
A place where minds begin to soar.<br>
Not just mushrooms, no — they’re keys,<br>
To lands beyond the winds and trees.<br>

So linger here, and breathe in deep,<br>
Let silence through your senses seep.<br>
For in this frame, wild magic grows—<br>
A forest only dreamers know.<br>
