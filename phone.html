        <h4>
        With turban tied and eyes gone wide,<br>
He held his phone up to the side.<br>
A puzzled look, a raised brow tight,<br>
This wasn’t going quite so right.<br>

"Hello?" he asked, with growing fear,<br>
"But what you say, I cannot hear!"<br>
The signal weak, the words unclear,<br>
He poked his arm to check — “Is it here?”<br>

He flipped the phone, he gave a shake,<br>
As if the fault was some mistake.<br>
His shirt was torn, his patience thin,<br>
This call was not a lucky win.<br>

“Recharge I did! Just yesterday!”<br>
He mumbled loud in disarray.<br>
“But now this thing just mocks my fate—<br>
And eats my balance while I wait!”<br>

Poor man, just trying to call his son,<br>
Who said he’d come by half-past one.<br>
But all he got was static tone,<br>
And the echo of a dial tone.<br>

A tale as old as time, you see,<br>
Of tech and man in rivalry.<br>
In every town, on every street—<br>
Someone’s stuck in this same repeat.<br>
