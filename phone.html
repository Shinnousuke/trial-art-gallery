        <h4>The Story Behind</h4>
        <p>With turban tied and eyes gone wide,
He held his phone up to the side.
A puzzled look, a raised brow tight,
This wasn’t going quite so right.

"Hello?" he asked, with growing fear,
"But what you say, I cannot hear!"
The signal weak, the words unclear,
He poked his arm to check — “Is it here?”

He flipped the phone, he gave a shake,
As if the fault was some mistake.
His shirt was torn, his patience thin,
This call was not a lucky win.

“Recharge I did! Just yesterday!”
He mumbled loud in disarray.
“But now this thing just mocks my fate—
And eats my balance while I wait!”

Poor man, just trying to call his son,
Who said he’d come by half-past one.
But all he got was static tone,
And the echo of a dial tone.

A tale as old as time, you see,
Of tech and man in rivalry.
In every town, on every street—
Someone’s stuck in this same repeat.
